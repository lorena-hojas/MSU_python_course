    "Generally, what you'll need to try next is taking a normal dataframe that has latitude and longitude columns. Then, you can convert this into a geopandas dataframe. Then, since lattitude and longitude are polar coordinates, you'll just assign a CRS to it (EPSG:4326). Then, you'll use to_crs() to convert that frame into rectangular coordinates (EPSG:3814) for more calculations. That's it. You don't have to start from shapefiles."
